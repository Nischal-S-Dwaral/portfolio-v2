I worked with him as a Project Manager for about 3 to 4 months on a conversational AI chatbot product focused on checking device recommendation and compatibility. His professionalism, and dedication to continuous improvement greatly contributed to the success of our team. \n' +

            'One such example of this dedication was when we were trying to shorten the release process for a Staging deployment through Rakuten Cloud Platform. This deployment process has 7 steps and 3 approval checks that typically takes 1 week to finish. Stepping outside of his role, Nischal outlined the release process, provided clear execution steps, sequencing, and estimates. This allowed us to have a common understanding of the process and build out a plan to line up our information for fast approvals. We were able to deploy into Staging in less than 3 hours — a remarkable achievement, compared to an average of 1 week.\n' +
