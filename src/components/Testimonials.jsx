I was fortunate enough to have Nischal as my cheerleading senior all through my engineering, he definitely plays a role in the person I am today. He has helped me to understand the placements process in the college, the do's and don'ts of interviews, the aptitude training to enhance quantitative, verbal, logical & reasoning skills. He has helped me acquire the technical knowledge ranging from DS, Algorithms, Database to OS. Nischal has a great rapport with his peers and an unbelievable willingness to help others.
                        I can firmly attest to his abilities, preparedness, dedication and efforts as a mentor. He would be a great addition to any team. Wishing him great success ahead."
